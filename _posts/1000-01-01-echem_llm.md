## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview
**What:** Fine-tuned Qwen2.5-VL to analyze electrochemical graphs (CVs/DPVs), extracting quantitative features and providing scientific interpretations for integration into autonomous laboratory systems.  
**Why:** Electrochemistry offers unparalleled speed and accuracy for chemical measurements, making it highly desirable across research and industry. However, the specialized and nuanced analysis required to interpret the data creates a major bottleneck. This model solves that barrier, enabling both human researchers and agentic systems to leverage electrochemistry's full potential.  
**Impact:** Achieved 95% accuracy on peak detection and electrochemical question-answering, creating a robust tool for autonomous experimental workflows and data interpretation pipelines.
