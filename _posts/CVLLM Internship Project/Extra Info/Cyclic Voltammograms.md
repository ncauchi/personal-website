Cyclic Voltammograms (CVs) are fundamental analytical tools in electrochemistry that measure current response during controlled voltage sweeps of chemical samples. These measurements produce characteristic graphs containing distinct 'peaks' that correspond to oxidation and reduction reactions occurring in the sample.

These peaks contain critical information about the chemical composition and electrochemical properties of samples. Experienced electrochemists can readily identify these features by eye and use them to gain insight into the properties and chemical composition of the sample.
